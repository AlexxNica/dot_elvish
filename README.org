* My configuration files for [[https://elvish.io/][Elvish]]

I recently discovered the [[https://elvish.io/][Elvish]] shell, and I find it very interesting
and have started using it as my main shell on macOS. This is my
current =~/.elvish= configuration directory, including several modules I
have written. You can find the full documentation in the [[file:rc.org][rc.org file]].

I hope you find them useful!
