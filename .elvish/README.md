# My configuration files for [Elvish](https://elvish.io/)

I recently discovered the [Elvish](https://elvish.io/) shell, and I
find it very interesting and have started using it as my main shell on
macOS. This is my current `~/.elvish` configuration directory. In
addition to my main [rc.elv](rc.elv) file, it includes a few packages
I have created and which you might find useful:

- [chain](lib/chain.elv): Chain prompt theme, based on the fish theme
  at https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-chain
- [prompt\_hooks](lib/prompt_hooks.elv): Convenience functions to add
  hooks to the prompt hook lists
- [proxy](lib/proxy.elv): Automating manipulation of proxy variables
- [long-running-notifications](lib/long-running-notifications.elv):
  Produce notifications for long-running commands

I hope you find them useful!
